comment: we must auto detect the tasks and other things by AI

comment: For example here are some keywords

todo: something to do.
todo: learn AI
todo: Deep Learning

fixme: this function doesn't work
fixme: The code is too large

attr: test attribute1
attr: test attribute2
attr: test attribute3
attr: test attribute4

Whe also must detect the pattern (regex) of keywords 
and save all of them in a file and then send them 
even to server or something {comment}


/idea/ We had better to create an updater script to
auto update the app and such things and controllers

/idea/ test idea for pattern detection
